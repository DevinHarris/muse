# Muse

> Muse is small Python script to add missing metadata to music files.

> For downloaded single songs (not full albums), I like to organize them by putting their
song title first and then append " - Single" onto them. This script makes it very easy and
quick to do so. 

> I plan on extending this script further as I get more comfortable with Python. Improving
the logic and adding other metadata from an API are on my todo list.
